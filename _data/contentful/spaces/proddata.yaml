    A sampling of our many services includes early and periodic screening, detection and treatment for mental health symptoms, crisis intervention for children and youth at risk of out of home placement or psychiatric hospitalization, and in-home therapy for parents at risk of having their children removed by the child welfare system.

    Our teams of providers work to create a flexible and individualized plan to meet the struggles that each family is facing and increase safety and stability in the home environment.

    We stay the course with our families, empowering parents by improving the quality of the parent-child relationship and helping to ensure long-term family success.
