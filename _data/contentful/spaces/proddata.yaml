  postBody: "As a young couple with a toddler, Allegra and Joseph weren’t thinking
    about becoming foster parents, particularly for a teenager. But then they met
    Jamie.  \n\nJamie had been split up from her siblings and placed in a series of
    foster homes, attending 13 different schools.  “We became foster parents to Jamie
    because we wanted her to have permanency in her life,” Joseph said. \n\nAllegra
    and Joseph loved Jamie unconditionally, helping her overcome her anxiety and recognize
    her abilities. “Being a foster parent is more than housing somebody; Joseph said.
    “You should be teaching somebody to succeed in life.” \n\nJamie says her foster
    parents changed her life, helping her transition into young adulthood and become
    a successful college student.  After graduating from college with a degree in
    Social Work, Jamie secured a job with the county as a social worker, supporting
    youth in foster care. “I just want to help make the world a little better, a little
    happier, and spread a little more love,” she said.\n\nAllegra and Joseph cannot
    imagine their lives without Jamie. “There needs to be more people willing to open
    their homes and their lives to help these kids, to keep them from getting hurt,”
    Allegra said. \n \n“She’s enriched our lives and taught us so much,” Joseph said.
    “We will always think of her as our daughter.”\n\n"

  postBody: "The day Alondra first met the team from Aspiranet’s Intensive Home-Based
    Services Wraparound program, she wasn’t up for visitors. It happened to be her
    16th birthday, and the team arrived at the motel room where she was staying with
    her parents and offered a cake and present.\n\n“I was like: I don’t want that;”
    Alondra recalls. “I don’t want a bunch of new strangers in my house wanting to
    know about me.” \n\nShe softened a bit when Wraparound facilitator Adam Corral
    asked what she needed. It wasn’t what you usually hear from someone turning 16,
    he said. She didn’t want a car or a phone; she wanted a safe place for her family
    to live. \n\nSupport counselor Erica Jacquez suggested the two of them go have
    lunch. “We went out to Chipotle, and she just opened up,” Erica said. “She started
    talking to me, sharing about her life experiences, what she’d gone through.” \n\nAlondra
    told Erica about how she had recently been reunited with her parents, who had
    turned their lives around after substance abuse problems had led to the placement
    of their six children in foster homes. Alondra and one of her brothers were back,
    and the family was looking for more permanent housing as a court hearing to reunite
    the four youngest boys approached. The motel where they were living was known
    for drugs, gangs and prostitution. Next door was a tent city that the family feared
    was their next step if they could not find an affordable apartment that would
    give them a chance. \n\nOver time, Erica and Alondra bonded over food and other
    shared interests. “We got really close,” Alondra said. With Erica’s guidance,
    Alondra set up a bank account, got her birth certificate, enrolled in school and
    found a job. \n\nAt the same time, other members of the Aspiranet team worked
    with Alondra’s parents. \n“We were in the motel room and the team just came in,
    sat on the beds and made themselves comfortable like they were part of the family,”
    said Alondra’s mother, Misty. “It set our nervousness aside.” \n\nParent partner
    Linnet Slater said Misty shared her concerns about finding food, permanent housing,
    even diapers for her young twin sons. “She had very real concerns, and I reassured
    her that we were here for her and her family,” Linnet said. “And that just started
    this beautiful blossom of a friendship that we’ve developed.”\n\nMisty felt heard
    and understood. “They showed that love and that compassion right out of the gate,”
    she said.\n\nWith Aspiranet’s help, the family finally was able to secure an apartment
    after repeatedly being turned away. The Aspiranet team also helped them get a
    van so the eight of them would not have to rely on buses to access food, work
    and school. \n\n“To get the phone call that yes, we have an apartment on the 1st,
    knowing we were going into court on the 1st to get the other four boys back--that
    I was going to have a home to take them to--that changed everything,” Misty said.
    Misty and her husband Albert found work, and they have since moved to a second
    apartment with more room for the kids. \n\nThe family celebrated their reunification
    by attending a Narcotics Anonymous meeting together. “I just thought that was
    so awesome that their way of celebrating was being sober and being together as
    a family,” Adam said. “The families we work with are so courageous; it takes tremendous
    courage to break cycles, and we’re talking generational cycles.”\n"

  postBody: "The Pillers’ home is always alive with the energy of children. Along
    with caring for their two young sons and daughter, whom they adopted through foster
    care, they serve as a “receiving home” for children when they are first placed
    in foster care. In that role, they have welcomed nearly 100 children to their
    home. \n \nTim and Jenny Piller decided to look into adopting through foster care
    after trying for years to have biological children.\n\n“There are so many children
    that just want someone to love them,” Jenny says.\n\nThe Pillers looked into four
    agencies before they decided to work with Aspiranet. They were attracted by the
    support that Aspiranet provides throughout the process and the team’s dedication
    to finding the right home for every child. \n\n“Aspiranet wants every child to
    go to a safe home – they want them to be loved,” Jenny said. “They were very supportive,
    and they worked hard to make us feel comfortable. We really appreciate how flexible
    they were with us. I would recommend Aspiranet to anybody.” \n\nAfter attending
    orientation classes with other foster and adoptive parents, the Pillers brought
    a two-day old infant into their home. Six months later, they began fostering a
    one-year old boy. \n\nThe second child wasn’t speaking or interacting with them,
    and they worried about his development. But after a few months, Tim said, “he
    just blossomed.”\n\n“With fostering, it’s neat to see the children change so much.
    They come in scared sometimes, and to watch them grow and become part of a family,
    that’s extremely rewarding to us.”\n\nEventually, another child joined their family
    — a little girl. \n\n“We fell in love with her the moment she came into our house,
    so that wasn’t a hard decision,” laughs Jenny.\n\n“Every foster kid that comes
    into our house is part of our family,” says Tim. “They go on vacation with us,
    if we’re doing it, they’re doing it. That inclusiveness gives them a sense of
    belonging and a sense of family.”\n\nThe Pillers have fostered dozens of children
    over the years, and they still enjoy relationships with many of them.\n\n“Sometimes
    we run into them and they remember us years later, and come up to us and give
    us hugs!” says Jenny. \n"

  postBody: "A chance encounter two years ago inspired Jennifer Goodrich to start
    a family through foster care.\n\nShe was in a public restroom when she heard a
    woman crying, and soon discovered that what she heard were tears of joy.  The
    woman had been overcome when her foster daughter asked her if she would adopt
    her and make their family permanent.\n\nSoon after, Jennifer made her way to Aspiranet,
    which was recommended to her by the woman she felt fated to meet. \n\nShe credits
    Aspiranet’s thorough training with helping her to feel confident and secure in
    the moments before meeting three-year-old Sam.  Jennifer felt an instant connection,
    and weekly meetings with her social worker helped solidify the bond and smooth
    the transition to making the adoption official.\n\nHaving Aspiranet by her side
    before, during, and after Sam’s adoption have made all the difference, Jennifer
    said. “The adoption did not happen overnight, but the process was seamless,” Jennifer
    said.  “Aspiranet worked hand-in-hand with me to become an adoptive parent, making
    it much easier.” \n\n “In foster parenting and adoption, there are always challenges,
    but the rewards make it worth it. I couldn’t be more grateful for the extra support
    Sam and I received from the Aspiranet staff on this journey.”\n\n"

  postBody: "Chris Essary earned a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology from California
    State University, Stanislaus, and began his Aspiranet career in 1987 as an Excell
    Center House Parent.  During his three decades at Aspiranet, he has served in
    a variety of roles including Regional Director, Group Home Administrator, Director
    of Operations, House Manager, and Activities Director.\n\nToday, he is the Director
    of Aspiranet’s Residential Division. “We joke that if you work here two years,
    you’re going to be here forever,” Chris says. There’s something about changing
    kids’ lives.”\n\n“The core value most important in my daily residential work is
    respect,” says Chris. I am inspired by our staff’s dedication to helping kids
    turn their lives around.  I like to come to work every day in a job that improves
    lives.  We have great people who work here and I take pride in our contribution
    to bettering our communities.”\n\nThe relationships Chris forms with many of the
    youth he calls “our boys” endure for years.  Among those he still hears from is
    Ralph, who was a resident more than 25 years ago.\n\nAfter graduating from Excell,
    Ralph went on to enlist in the army, and before he was deployed to Iraq, he sent
    a letter to Chris expressing his gratitude for the program. “Ralph wanted us to
    know if something happened how important we were to him,” Chris said. “It touched
    my heart.”\n\nAfter returning from his duty in Iraq, Ralph returned to Excell
    Center for a visit.  Twenty-five years melted away as Chris and Ralph shared stories
    of the good old days.  Ralph is now living in Idaho with his beautiful wife and
    three children.  \n\nIt’s these kinds of connections, Chris said, that make it
    all worthwhile.\n"

  postBody: "When Sanat and his family relocated to the East Bay from India for a
    job opportunity in the tech industry, everybody felt a bit disoriented. His young
    son, Yatharth, became very fearful of strangers and would cry whenever anyone
    approached.\n\nEager to help his son adjust, Sanat decided to investigate fatherhood
    classes at Aspiranet’s Monument First 5 Center in Concord, which provides services
    to families with children 0-5 years old. Sanat admits he was a bit skeptical at
    first. \n\n “I thought, ‘Why do I need those classes? I can watch the best parenting
    videos. But then I thought, let’s just give it a chance.”\n\nAs a software engineer,
    Sanat’s instincts were to look for answers online. It took only one class for
    him to recognize the value of sharing experiences with other fathers. \n\n“The
    other fathers started speaking, and I found that’s not the same thing I can get
    from videos,” he says. “Here I can see the real scenarios, and I can teach myself
    how to handle the same scenario with my kid. Every day was a new learning for
    me.”\n\nSanat realized this was more than he was going to get from any social
    network or YouTube. After the first day, he says, “I never missed a class.” \n\n![Kumar](//images.contentful.com/e5ehlcazegi0/5ohWXc4N0s2uWSQeU4eQsC/b787848d455395d0e11cd3f716fffe19/30640657903_a681a78450_o.jpg)\n\nSanat
    is especially grateful for the diverse, multilingual staff who have created a
    welcoming environment for families from a variety of backgrounds.\n\n“Everybody
    wants to be a good parent, so the motive is the same: everyone wants to give the
    best to their child. I saw that everyone wants to speak-- whether their native
    language was Spanish, or Hindi, or English-- they want to speak.”\n\n“They want
    to tell their stories, and the staff create that environment. After that I started
    speaking.”\n\nHis wife Babita also comes to the First 5 Center three times a week
    with their son, and they’ve seen a dramatic change in Yatharth’s behavior. \n\n“After
    two weeks he started hanging out with the other kids, and now he’s perfectly fine
    and I really feel a big relief,” Sanat says. “That teacher’s patience, teaching
    my wife and me how to handle our son when he’s cranky — all the credit goes to
    this place.”\n"

  postBody: "Veronica Morales, a housing specialist with Aspiranet’s Transitional
    Aged Youth programs, knows first-hand what’s it’s like to live on the streets.
    She spent much of her youth in foster care, and then when she became pregnant
    at 18, she moved out of her foster home and ended up living in her car with her
    infant son. “It was just survival every day,” she said. “That makes me think about
    every youth that I work with every day. I know exactly how they feel.”\n\nThings
    changed in 2008, when Veronica was offered the opportunity to participate in Aspiranet’s
    Transitional Housing Plus (THP+) program, which provides housing assistance, job
    readiness and life skills training. “The program was like a miracle out of nowhere,”
    she said. \n\nIn the years since, Veronica has completed her education and returned
    to Aspiranet as a TAY staff member, helping youth find their way from foster care
    to independence. \n\nHer son is almost a teenager. “I’ve taught him this world
    can be a cruel place,” she says, “but you can make it a happier place if you’re
    just who you are and keep doing what you do from a good place in your heart.”

    support so they can thrive. Whether you are a foster parent, relative or extended
    family member, you can provide a home for a child to do just that.\n\nAspiranet
    is committed to providing the best possible care for children in foster care and
    helping to reunite families.\n\nWe partner with foster parents in building specialized
    skills to effectively care for children who have experienced instability and trauma
    – providing ongoing resources, information and support. \n\nResearch has proven
    what a difference it makes for children to have at least one caring and consistent
    relationship with a reliable adult.\n\nFoster parents provide a stable, loving
    haven for children to begin healing from trauma and to reunite with their birth
    families.  \n\nWhen children cannot return home safely, foster parents often help
    with their transition to a permanent family and become an ongoing connection for
    the child. Sometimes they adopt or become guardians of the child."

    for inside a stable, healthy family.\n\nAspiranet works to assure a secure and

    to their families is not an option.\n\nWe are thoughtful and trustworthy in how
    we match foster children and youth with adoptive families, looking for the best
    fit where both can be successful.  \nWe partner with our families in providing
    education, resources and support at all stages of the adoption process.  \n\nThere
    is no better gift than to provide a child with the love and support so they can

  steps: "<p class=\"round\">Steps to Becoming a Foster or Adoptive Parent</p> \n\nWe
    understand that choosing to become a foster or adoptive parent is one of the most
    significant decisions you will make.  We want you to know that we will be with
    you every step of the way, helping you to feel confident in your decision and
    excited about the opportunity to make a difference in the life of a child.  The
    process of becoming a foster or adoptive parent may vary slightly depending on
    a family’s unique situation but the steps below provide an overall guideline of
    what you can expect.\n\n<ol class=\"custom-counter\">\n<li><p>Speak with one of
    our Family Coordinators who are here to discuss the process in more detail, review
    the requirements, and answer your questions. </p></li> \n\n<li><p>Take the next
    step to getting involved.  Some families want to meet at their local Aspiranet
    office to discuss fostering or adopting in more detail before training.  Others
    are ready to begin the process by signing up for parent education classes at a
    nearby location.\n</p></li> \n\n<li><p>Once a family has completed the parent
    education classes we will work with you to determine whether it makes sense to
    begin the background check and paperwork requirements.  This includes Department
    of Justice and Child Abuse Index background checks, DMV driving report, CPR and
    First Aid training, physical and TB testing, and other application forms.  \n</p></li>
    \  \n\n<li><p>As you work through your paperwork, the local Aspiranet office will
    also set up an interview to learn about your family’s unique skills and needs
    as a foster or adoptive parent.</p></li>     \n\n<li><p>Complete a home environment
    check and a psychosocial assessment.  This process will assure that your home
    is compliant with applicable safety laws for foster and adoptive parents in the
    state of California.  We have plenty of resources to prepare you for this visit
    ahead of time.</p></li>     \n\n<li><p>Become an approved foster or adoptive family!
    \ Once you have successfully completed the steps outlined above, your local Aspiranet
    office will approve your family to begin caring for children and youth who are
    placed in foster care.  Your social worker will partner with you to determine
    how to best match a child with your family and provide ongoing assistance in supporting
    the child, or children, in your care.  For families interested in adoption, this
    may include adoption matching and home study.</p></li>  \n</ol>\nOur Family Coordinators
    are here to answer your questions and walk you through the process so you can
    feel confident in your decision to move forward.  Sign up for more information
    or call 1-877-380-4376.\n"
  requirements: "<p class=\"round\">Requirements</p>\n\nWe believe every child deserves
    to live in a safe and stable family, so we work to ensure that every Aspiranet
    Family can provide just that. We partner with our families to ensure that welcoming
    a child or  youth into your home is a positive, healthy and successful experience.
    \ Throughout the process our staff spends time with families understanding each
    unique situation, answering questions and identifying the possibilities that may
    be available.  The process of becoming a foster parent is guided by state and
    Aspiranet requirements including: \n \n<p class=\"bold\"> • Parents must be 21
    years of age or older</p> \n\n<p class=\"bold\"> • Families should have adequate
    space for a child in the home</p>\n\n<p class=\"bold\"> • Families should be financially
    self-sufficient</p>\n\n<p class=\"bold\"> • All adults over the age of 18 must
    clear a background check through Child Abuse Index and Department of Justice fingerprints</p>\n\n<p
    class=\"bold\"> • Parents must have a valid California driver’s license, clean
    10 year DMV driving record,  reliable transportation and proof of insurance</p>\n\n<p
    class=\"bold\"> • Parents will need to complete Aspiranet Parent Education classes,
    first aid course, family assessment interviews, home study, and a home fire and
    safety inspection</p>\n\n<p class=\"bold\">Interested in learning more about the
    guidelines listed above?</p>  \n\nOur family recruiters can answer your questions
    and provide more detail.  Fill out our contact form or call 1-877-380-4376.   "
  faq: "<p class=\"round\">Frequently Asked Questions</p>\n\nOur families have shared
    some of the most commonly asked questions as they begin the process.  \n\n<p class=\"round\">Can
    I provide input around the children that I feel fit with my family?</p>\n\nYes,
    Aspiranet works with each family to determine the best match between a child and
    family. It is important to remember that the majority of foster children are teenagers
    or siblings who sometimes have medical, emotional or mental health needs so it
    is important to keep an open mind around possibilities you may have not considered.
    \ Aspiranet will assist you in building your skills to support children and youth
    experiencing challenges around transitioning and healing from trauma.  \n\n<p
    class=\"round\">How long does it take to become an Aspiranet foster family?</p>\n\nIt
    typically takes a family between three to six months to become an Aspiranet foster
    family. The time can vary depending on how quickly a family completes the requirements.
    \ If families are interested in adopting this process will take longer as your
    social worker partners with you to identify a child who may be freed for adoption
    and complete the additional requirements specific to this process.  \n\n<p class=\"round\">Will
    a birth family be involved while I am caring for a child?</p>\n\nYes, in most
    circumstances a child’s family remains involved with their child through supervised
    visits while he/she is in foster care. The first priority for most children in
    foster care is to be safely reunified with their families. Many families improve
    their situation, allowing their children to return home. Your social worker will
    help you understand your role in supporting a child’s connection with their birth
    family.\n\n<p class=\"round\">How will Aspiranet help me if I am caring for a
    child with challenging behaviors?</p>\n\nMany of the children in foster care come
    with special medical, emotional or behavioral needs based on their past experiences
    and trauma they may have encountered. When your family is asked to care for a
    child, Aspiranet shares all information available regarding the needs, behaviors
    and habits of the child. Your social worker partners with your family and other
    adults involved with the child to determine his/her needs and then helps develop
    a plan that best addresses those needs. Some children will benefit from additional
    services and support, and your social worker can help identify needs and secure
    services. \n\n<p class=\"bold\">More questions?</p> \n\nSubmit a contact form
