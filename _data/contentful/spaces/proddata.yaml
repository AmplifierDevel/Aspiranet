    Morales, a housing specialist with Aspiranet’s Transitional Aged Youth programs,
    knows first-hand what’s it’s like to live on the streets. She spent much of her
    youth in foster care, and then when she became pregnant at 18, she moved out of
    her foster home and ended up living in her car with her infant son. “It was just
    survival every day,” she said. “That makes me think about every youth that I work
    with every day. I know exactly how they feel.”\n\nThings changed in 2008, when
    Veronica was offered the opportunity to participate in Aspiranet’s Transitional
    Housing Plus (THP+) program, which provides housing assistance, job readiness
    and life skills training. “The program was like a miracle out of nowhere,” she
    said. \n\nIn the years since, Veronica has completed her education and returned
    to Aspiranet as a TAY staff member, helping youth find their way from foster care
    to independence. \n\nHer son is almost a teenager. “I’ve taught him this world
    can be a cruel place,” she says, “but you can make it a happier place if you’re
    just who you are and keep doing what you do from a good place in your heart.”

  postBody: "A chance encounter two years ago inspired Jennifer Goodrich to start
    a family through foster care.\n\nShe was in a public restroom when she heard a
    woman crying, and soon discovered that what she heard were tears of joy.  The
    woman had been overcome when her foster daughter asked her if she would adopt
    her and make their family permanent.\n\nSoon after, Jennifer made her way to Aspiranet,
    which was recommended to her by the woman she felt fated to meet. \n\nShe credits
    Aspiranet’s thorough training with helping her to feel confident and secure in
    the moments before meeting three-year-old Sam.  Jennifer felt an instant connection,
    and weekly meetings with her social worker helped solidify the bond and smooth
    the transition to making the adoption official.\n\nHaving Aspiranet by her side
    before, during, and after Sam’s adoption have made all the difference, Jennifer
    said. “The adoption did not happen overnight, but the process was seamless,” Jennifer
    said.  “Aspiranet worked hand-in-hand with me to become an adoptive parent, making
    it much easier.” \n\n “In foster parenting and adoption, there are always challenges,
    but the rewards make it worth it. I couldn’t be more grateful for the extra support
    Sam and I received from the Aspiranet staff on this journey.”\n\n"

  postBody: "The Pillars’ home is always alive with the energy of children. Along
    with caring for their two young sons and daughter, whom they adopted through foster
    care, they serve as a “receiving home” for children when they are first placed
    in foster care. In that role, they have welcomed nearly 100 children to their
    home. \n \nTim and Jenny Pillar decided to look into adopting through foster care
    after trying for years to have biological children.\n\n“There are so many children
    that just want someone to love them,” Jenny says.\n\nThe Pillars looked into four
    agencies before they decided to work with Aspiranet. They were attracted by the
    support that Aspiranet provides throughout the process and the team’s dedication
    to finding the right home for every child. \n\n“Aspiranet wants every child to
    go to a safe home – they want them to be loved,” Jenny said. “They were very supportive,
    and they worked hard to make us feel comfortable. We really appreciate how flexible
    they were with us. I would recommend Aspiranet to anybody.” \n\nAfter attending
    orientation classes with other foster and adoptive parents, the Pillars brought
    a two-day old infant into their home. Six months later, they began fostering a
    one-year old boy. \n\nThe second child wasn’t speaking or interacting with them,
    and they worried about his development. But after a few months, Tim said, “he
    just blossomed.”\n\n“With fostering, it’s neat to see the children change so much.
    They come in scared sometimes, and to watch them grow and become part of a family,
    that’s extremely rewarding to us.”\n\nEventually, another child joined their family
    — a little girl. \n\n“We fell in love with her the moment she came into our house,
    so that wasn’t a hard decision,” laughs Jenny.\n\n“Every foster kid that comes
    into our house is part of our family,” says Tim. “They go on vacation with us,
    if we’re doing it, they’re doing it. That inclusiveness gives them a sense of
    belonging and a sense of family.”\n\nThe Pillars have fostered dozens of children
    over the years, and they still enjoy relationships with many of them.\n\n“Sometimes
    we run into them and they remember us years later, and come up to us and give
    us hugs!” says Jenny. \n"

  postBody: "As a young couple with a toddler, Allegra and Joseph weren’t thinking
    about becoming foster parents, particularly for a teenager. But then they met
    Jamie.  \n\nJamie had been split up from her siblings and placed in a series of
    foster homes, attending 13 different schools.  “We became foster parents to Jamie
    because we wanted her to have permanency in her life,” Joseph said. \n\nAllegra
    and Joseph loved Jamie unconditionally, helping her overcome her anxiety and recognize
    her abilities. “Being a foster parent is more than housing somebody; Joseph said.
    “You should be teaching somebody to succeed in life.” \n\nJamie says her foster
    parents changed her life, helping her transition into young adulthood and become
    a successful college student.  After graduating from college with a degree in
    Social Work, Jamie secured a job with the county as a social worker, supporting
    youth in foster care. “I just want to help make the world a little better, a little
    happier, and spread a little more love,” she said.\n\nAllegra and Joseph cannot
    imagine their lives without Jamie. “There needs to be more people willing to open
    their homes and their lives to help these kids, to keep them from getting hurt,”
    Allegra said. \n \n“She’s enriched our lives and taught us so much,” Joseph said.
    “We will always think of her as our daughter.”\n\n"

  postBody: "The day Alondra first met the team from Aspiranet’s Intensive Home-Based
    Services Wraparound program, she wasn’t up for visitors. It happened to be her
    16th birthday, and the team arrived at the motel room where she was staying with
    her parents and offered a cake and present.\n\n“I was like: I don’t want that;”
    Alondra recalls. “I don’t want a bunch of new strangers in my house wanting to
    know about me.” \n\nShe softened a bit when Wraparound facilitator Adam Corral
    asked what she needed. It wasn’t what you usually hear from someone turning 16,
    he said. She didn’t want a car or a phone; she wanted a safe place for her family
    to live. \n\nSupport counselor Erica Jacquez suggested the two of them go have
    lunch. “We went out to Chipotle, and she just opened up,” Erica said. “She started
    talking to me, sharing about her life experiences, what she’d gone through.” \n\nAlondra
    told Erica about how she had recently been reunited with her parents, who had
    turned their lives around after substance abuse problems had led to the placement
    of their six children in foster homes. Alondra and one of her brothers were back,
    and the family was looking for more permanent housing as a court hearing to reunite
    the four youngest boys approached. The motel where they were living was known
    for drugs, gangs and prostitution. Next door was a tent city that the family feared
    was their next step if they could not find an affordable apartment that would
    give them a chance. \n\nOver time, Erica and Alondra bonded over food and other
    shared interests. “We got really close,” Alondra said. With Erica’s guidance,
    Alondra set up a bank account, got her birth certificate, enrolled in school and
    found a job. \n\nAt the same time, other members of the Aspiranet team worked
    with Alondra’s parents. \n“We were in the motel room and the team just came in,
    sat on the beds and made themselves comfortable like they were part of the family,”
    said Alondra’s mother, Misty. “It set our nervousness aside.” \n\nParent partner
    Linnet Slater said Misty shared her concerns about finding food, permanent housing,
    even diapers for her young twin sons. “She had very real concerns, and I reassured
    her that we were here for her and her family,” Linnet said. “And that just started
    this beautiful blossom of a friendship that we’ve developed.”\n\nMisty felt heard
    and understood. “They showed that love and that compassion right out of the gate,”
    she said.\n\nWith Aspiranet’s help, the family finally was able to secure an apartment
    after repeatedly being turned away. The Aspiranet team also helped them get a
    van so the eight of them would not have to rely on buses to access food, work
    and school. \n\n“To get the phone call that yes, we have an apartment on the 1st,
    knowing we were going into court on the 1st to get the other four boys back--that
    I was going to have a home to take them to--that changed everything,” Misty said.
    Misty and her husband Albert found work, and they have since moved to a second
    apartment with more room for the kids. \n\nThe family celebrated their reunification
    by attending a Narcotics Anonymous meeting together. “I just thought that was
    so awesome that their way of celebrating was being sober and being together as
    a family,” Adam said. “The families we work with are so courageous; it takes tremendous
    courage to break cycles, and we’re talking generational cycles.”\n"

  postBody: "When Sanat and his family relocated to the East Bay from India for a
    job opportunity in the tech industry, everybody felt a bit disoriented. His young
    son, Yatharth, became very fearful of strangers and would cry whenever anyone
    approached.\n\nEager to help his son adjust, Sanat decided to investigate fatherhood
    classes at Aspiranet’s Monument First 5 Center in Concord, which provides services
    to families with children 0-5 years old. Sanat admits he was a bit skeptical at
    first. \n\n “I thought, ‘Why do I need those classes? I can watch the best parenting
    videos. But then I thought, let’s just give it a chance.”\n\nAs a software engineer,
    Sanat’s instincts were to look for answers online. It took only one class for
    him to recognize the value of sharing experiences with other fathers. \n\n“The
    other fathers started speaking, and I found that’s not the same thing I can get
    from videos,” he says. “Here I can see the real scenarios, and I can teach myself
    how to handle the same scenario with my kid. Every day was a new learning for
    me.”\n\nSanat realized this was more than he was going to get from any social
    network or YouTube. After the first day, he says, “I never missed a class.” \n\n![Kumar](//images.contentful.com/e5ehlcazegi0/5ohWXc4N0s2uWSQeU4eQsC/b787848d455395d0e11cd3f716fffe19/30640657903_a681a78450_o.jpg)\n\nSanat
    is especially grateful for the diverse, multilingual staff who have created a
    welcoming environment for families from a variety of backgrounds.\n\n“Everybody
    wants to be a good parent, so the motive is the same: everyone wants to give the
    best to their child. I saw that everyone wants to speak-- whether their native
    language was Spanish, or Hindi, or English-- they want to speak.”\n\n“They want
    to tell their stories, and the staff create that environment. After that I started
    speaking.”\n\nHis wife Babita also comes to the First 5 Center three times a week
    with their son, and they’ve seen a dramatic change in Yatharth’s behavior. \n\n“After
    two weeks he started hanging out with the other kids, and now he’s perfectly fine
    and I really feel a big relief,” Sanat says. “That teacher’s patience, teaching
    my wife and me how to handle our son when he’s cranky — all the credit goes to
    this place.”\n"

    of Aspiranet’s Residential Division. “We joke that if you work here two years,
    you’re going to be here forever,” Chris says. There’s something about changing
    kids’ lives.”\n\n“The core value most important in my daily residential work is
    respect,” says Chris. I am inspired by our staff’s dedication to helping kids
    turn their lives around.  I like to come to work every day in a job that improves
    lives.  We have great people who work here and I take pride in our contribution
    to bettering our communities.”\n\nThe relationships Chris forms with many of the
    youth he calls “our boys” endure for years.  Among those he still hears from is
    Ralph, who was a resident more than 25 years ago.\n\nAfter graduating from Excell,
    Ralph went on to enlist in the army, and before he was deployed to Iraq, he sent
    a letter to Chris expressing his gratitude for the program. “Ralph wanted us to
    know if something happened how important we were to him,” Chris said. “It touched
    my heart.”\n\nAfter returning from his duty in Iraq, Ralph returned to Excell
    Center for a visit.  Twenty-five years melted away as Chris and Ralph shared stories
    of the good old days.  Ralph is now living in Idaho with his beautiful wife and
    three children.  \n\nIt’s these kinds of connections, Chris said, that make it
    all worthwhile.\n"

  faq: |-
    __Do I have a say in the child(ren) placed in my home?__

    Yes, Aspiranet works with each family to determine who they believe they can best care for in their home. It’s important to remember that the majority of foster children are teenagers or siblings who sometimes have medical, emotional or mental health needs.

    __How long does it take to become an Aspiranet foster parent?__

    It typically takes a family between three and six months to become an Aspiranet foster parent. The time can vary depending on how quickly a family completes the requirements.

    __Can anyone be an Aspiranet foster parent?__

    Aspiranet encourages you to consider becoming a foster parent. All foster parents must meet certain requirements prior to certification, such as: being financially self-sufficient, having adequate bedroom space and meeting all state required criminal clearances. Aspiranet staff work closely with each family to help them complete the requirements for foster parent certification.

    __Would a child’s family be involved while a child was living in my home?__

    Yes, in most circumstances a child’s family remains involved with their child while he/she is in foster care. The first priority for most children in foster care is to be safely reunified with their families. Most families improve their situation, allowing their children to return home. Foster parents have a big role in supporting a child’s connection with their family, often through regular visits. Aspiranet works with foster parents to help them understand their role in supporting a child’s connection with their family.

    __How will Aspiranet help me if I have a child with difficult behaviors?__

    Many of the children in foster care come with special medical, emotional or behavioral needs. When a child is placed with your family, Aspiranet shares all information available regarding the needs, behaviors and habits of the child. The Aspiranet Social Worker works with foster parent and other adults involved with the child in determining his/her needs and then helps develop a plan that best addresses those needs. Some children will benefits from additional services and support; the Aspiranet Social Worker will work with each family and child to identifying and secure those services.
